### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Welcome to my profile!

I'm Turtle84375, but you can just call me Turtle. I'm a budding computer programmer and an experienced (if I do say so myself) web developer. I oversee multiple different websites ranging from forums to professional webpages to fun sandbox sites. On GitHub, I do things like push code to my websites and help other people out with debugging their own code.

#### My Interests (Coding Related)
- Administration/moderation work
- Javascript coding
- Software configuration
- Foruming

#### My Interests (Offline)
- Protecting my privacy by not including too many personal details in my public biography ;)

#### My Websites
_Please note that this list excludes a few websites which I have created but are not available to the general public._
- [turtle84375.tk](turtle84375.tk) (my personal sandbox website, just for fun)

- TrackTask _LINK COMING SOON_ (a private & sharable task management webapp)
- [The Techy Forums](https://techy.boards.net) (the tech forum that I run)

#### Need Help?
I'd be glad to help you with your bugs or other programming & software related needs. I also have moderation experience on my own and other sites. Feel free to contact me for more details.
